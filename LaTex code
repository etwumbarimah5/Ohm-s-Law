% --- CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION ---
\chapter{Introduction} % 
\label{ch:introduction}

This report details an assignment designed to explore and validate Ohm's Law through the use of Proteus simulation software.  The primary objective is to simulate a fundamental DC circuit and meticulously analyze the relationship between the current flowing through a fixed resistor and the applied voltage across it. 

\section{Background: Ohm's Law} % 
\label{sec:background}

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering, stating a direct proportionality between the voltage across a conductor and the current flowing through it, provided the temperature and other physical conditions remain constant.  Mathematically, it is expressed as: 
$$V=I\times R$$ 
Where: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item V represents voltage, measured in Volts (V). 
    \item I represents current, measured in Amperes (A). 
    \item R represents resistance, measured in Ohms ($\Omega$). 
\end{itemize}
The core requirement of this assignment is to experimentally prove this relationship by constructing a virtual circuit within the Proteus environment and subsequently analyzing the obtained results. 

% --- CHAPTER 2: MATERIALS ---
\chapter{Materials (Proteus Components)} % 
\label{ch:materials}

The following virtual components were utilized in the Proteus simulation environment to construct and analyze the circuit: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item DC Voltage Source (variable) 
    \item Fixed Resistor (e.g., 100 $\Omega$) 
    \item Ammeter (for measuring current in series) 
    \item Voltmeter or Voltage Probes (for measuring voltage across the resistor) 
    \item Ground Terminal 
    \item Connecting Wires 
\end{itemize}

% --- CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY ---
\chapter{Methodology} % 
\label{ch:methodology}

The validation of Ohm's Law was carried out following a systematic procedure within the Proteus simulation software. 

\section{Circuit Construction} % 
\label{sec:circuit-construction}

A simple DC circuit was meticulously built in Proteus, adhering to the following configuration: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A DC power source was connected to provide the necessary voltage. 
    \item One fixed resistor (e.g., 100 $\Omega$) was incorporated into the circuit. 
    \item An ammeter was connected in series with the resistor to measure the total circuit current. 
    \item A voltmeter was connected in parallel across the fixed resistor to measure the voltage drop across it. 
    \item A proper ground connection was established to complete the circuit and provide a reference potential. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Simulation and Data Collection} % 
\label{sec:simulation-data-collection}

The constructed circuit was simulated under varying voltage conditions while keeping the fixed resistor value constant.  Three distinct voltage values were applied, and the corresponding current readings were meticulously recorded.  The typical voltage values used were 5V, 10V, and 15V. 

% --- CHAPTER 4: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ---
\chapter{Results and Discussion} % 
\label{ch:results}

The data collected from the Proteus simulation is presented in the table below.  This table illustrates how the current through the fixed resistor changes as the applied voltage is varied.

        \textbf{Applied Voltage (V)} & \textbf{Fixed Resistance ($\Omega$)} & \textbf{Measured Current (A)} \\ % 
        \hline
        5 & 100 & 0.05 \\ % 
        10 & 100 & 0.10 \\ % 
        15 & 100 & 0.15 \\ % 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

% --- CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSION ---
\chapter{Conclusion} % 
\label{ch:conclusion}

Based on the experimental data, it was observed that as the applied voltage was progressively increased from 5V to 10V and then to 15V, the measured current correspondingly increased from 0.05A to 0.1A and further to 0.15A.  This direct proportionality between voltage and current, for a fixed resistance, effectively validates Ohm's Law.
